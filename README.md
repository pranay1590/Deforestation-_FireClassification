🔥 Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data (2021–2023)

This project aims to classify different types of fire incidents in India using remote sensing data from NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellites — Terra and Aqua — collected between 2021 and 2023. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze satellite-detected thermal anomalies to accurately categorize fire events such as forest fires, agricultural burning, and other thermal hotspots.
